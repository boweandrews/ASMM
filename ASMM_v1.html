The series of tasks will take <b>approximately 30 minutes to complete</b>. The information you give in the study will be handled confidentially. Personal information about you will not be published or made available to any third party in any form. Your name will <b>not</b> be used in any report (pseudonyms such as ‘Participant X’ will be used) and we will be careful to ensure that no identifiable patterns in your actions or questionnaire responses (including demographic information such as your experience) are released in a way that would allow for any outsider to guess your identity. The risks involved are no greater than those involved in daily activities. There are no direct benefits to you for participating in this research study.<p>'+

The Office of Human Research Protections may also look at study records.</p>'+
